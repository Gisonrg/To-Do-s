CREATIVE_ADDITIONS.TXT

Apart from the basic functionality, we 
add new features like EXP and levels,
when user finish a task they will gain 
corresponding exp and when they have 
enough exp, their level will be increased.

Along with the exp, we also build leaderboard
for them to show off, as we list out the top
5 users in terms of their exp.

We also create a notification field to show
what happened. The events include “”New user 
sign up”, “Somebody creates a new task”, “
Somebody finishes a task”, and “somebody level
up”.
